NEW FEATURES:

make a undo and redo button

rename a file by clicking on the filename in edit mode
add a button to switch natural and new word
add a "delete all history button"
add a export to csv button
add search button
add option to do mixed direction (randomly chooses direction per word)

make an actual settings menu

flashcard mode, click to reveal answer, ask user if the got it correct

ask (for n != 0 3n else 1) times when the user gets it wrong

show origin file when hovering over a word in learn mode

go to current asked word when switching from learn mode to edit mode

show total learned words

add shortcuts (open, save, new file, switch, ...)


FIXES:
remove whitespace before and after words (learn and edit)

automatically uncollapse the file when a new pair is added (now it looks like nothing happens when you press the add pair button)

you can't scroll when the last wordpair is selected

progress bar in repeat mode still doesnt work sometimes (I think when doing only difficult words, the bar is wrong) (also make it gray instead of green)

words keep getting repeated when in repeat mode (fix: go through all the words once and then repeat), you can get words 3x in row if you're unlucky

open files in condensed view (if there are more than one files)

nicer end screen
-bigger numbers
-show line of red/green squares/dots of the words you got wrong 

DONE:


turn start button into stop button when started

auto delete wordpair when empty and backspace is pressed
